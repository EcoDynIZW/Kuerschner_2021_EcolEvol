Movement can mediate temporal mismatches between resource availability and biological events in host–pathogen interactions. *Ecology and Evolution* 11(10), 5728–5741, DOI: [10.1002/ece3.7478](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7478)

We used a spatially explicit individual-based eco-epidemiological model originally developed by [Scherer et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.07002). It is based on earlier models considering neighbourhood infections only which was developed by [Kramer-Schadt et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2008.16582.x) and [Lange et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-43-37). The model by [Scherer et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.07002) relies on individual movement decisions of host individuals, i.e. long-distance roaming movement of males (hereafter termed ‘movement’), a process important for disease transmission. We further modified the model by adding spatiotemporal landscape dynamics representing changing resource availability, a response of movement decisions to that landscape and a resource-based mortality. A complete and detailed model description following the modified ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Detail) protocol (Grimm et al., 2020, 2006) is provided in the supplementary material. The NetLogo model and the R code to analyse the simulation results are available on Zenodo [Kürschner et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4593791)
